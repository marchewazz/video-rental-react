# VIDEO RENTAL APP

This is an app that could be used for video rental. I used React with TypeScript, Tailwind, sockets and some libraries like Swiper to make it look better. 
Also it supports two languges of interface and black and dark theme. Sometimes hosting is a bit laggy and loading might take a bit longer :)
